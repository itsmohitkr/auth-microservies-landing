# Authentication Microservices Frontend

This project provides a frontend interface for interacting with the authentication microservices. It allows users to request access to the API and displays relevant documentation for API endpoints. The form sends a request to the backend microservices to obtain an API key, which is required to access the authenticated resources.

## Features

- **Welcome Section**: A brief introduction to the authentication microservices.
- **API Key Request Form**: Allows users to submit their details (name, email, application name) to request an API key.
- **Documentation**: Displays a well-structured list of API endpoints with example requests, responses, and relevant status codes.
